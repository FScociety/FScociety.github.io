The medium wasn&rsquo;t specified. Because of my experience with Blender, I thought about creating a 3D animated short film.</p><lite-youtube videoid=KPq-dPOjAKM playlabel="Play: Keynote (Google I/O '18)"></lite-youtube><h2 id=story>Story</h2><p>The short film is about two robots. At the beginning you only see a blue one (symbol for a man). He wakes up and discovers a silver sphere. On the way to it he has a flashback, how he meets a purple (symbol for a woman) robot. As the movie progresses, it turns out that this purple robot was once hit by a huge ball and the two were separated. The blue one continues on its journey and shoots away many balls until it comes across a big one. This one he cannot push away. He is about to be crushed when the purple robot appears with many white ones and together they save the blue one.</p><h2 id=roboter-creation>Roboter Creation</h2><p>At the beginning it was clear, the project should be about robots, but I was not sure how they should look. To find out, I made a few sketches and also modeled a few test models in Blender.</p><h2 id=story-creation>Story Creation</h2><h2 id=animation>Animation</h2><p>At &ldquo;1:38&rdquo;, a very large collection of robots is approaching the sphere. I simulated the whole thing with Blender and the &ldquo;Molecular-Addon&rdquo;. It was important to me to show the large masses of robots.</p><p>This scene is not directly in the movie, however the explosion is: &ldquo;1:53&rdquo;. For the implementation of the explosion I used the real-time simulation program EmberGen and imported it as an OpenVDB into Blender.</p></div></div></div></main><footer><div class=footer-container>This site was created by
