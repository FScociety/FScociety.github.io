I worked on it for a total of 1 year.</p><lite-youtube videoid=JR3cwxSdOB4 playlabel="Play: Keynote (Google I/O '18)"></lite-youtube><h2 id=story>Story</h2><p>The story is about a melon. In the beginning, it is carried to different places by an unknown force. It eventually finds itself in a refrigerator. From there, it breaks out a small piece of itself that explores the world. On its journey it admires: a drop of water, birds, a garage and a forest. Just as he is about to start a journey a flock of birds, the whole world collapses and the big melon wakes up next to hundreds of other melons. It is awaited there by a dark ending.</p><h2 id=story-creation>Story Creation</h2><div class=row-container><div class=row-content><div id=own-gallery class=own-gallery><div class=gallery-image><img src=media/story_board_01.webp alt></div><div class=gallery-image><img src=media/story_board_02.webp alt></div></div><style>.text p{text-align:left;margin-top:0}.left{margin:0 20px 0 0}.right{margin:0 0 0 20px}</style><div class="text right"><p>To get a rough overview of the scenes, I made some shot sketches for large story blocks. This was especially helpful for the drone shots, since I only had the drone available one afternoon, so I had to know beforehand what I was filming so that nothing would be missing when editing. It also helped to give the movie a general structure.</p></div></div></div><h2 id=models>Models</h2><div class=row-container><div class=row-content><style>.text p{text-align:left;margin-top:0}.left{margin:0 20px 0 0}.right{margin:0 0 0 20px}</style><div class="text left"><p>The melon was my first completely original character. Texturing, modeling and rigging, I did everything. When rigging, one particular difficulty was with the eyes. They had to look at a point in space that could be moved to any point. But I was able to solve the whole thing with a few bone constraints.</p></div><div class=gallery-image><video autoplay muted loop>

Unlike in the rest of the film, the melon here is a real model.

That took a lot of work because I didn't know if the scene was going to look good while I was shooting it. Also, I had limited spontaneity as opposed to pure CGI.</p></div></div></div><div class=row-container><div class=row-content><style>.text p{text-align:left;margin-top:0}.left{margin:0 20px 0 0}.right{margin:0 0 0 20px}</style><div class="text left"><p>Later in the film, birds send a message to the melon. The technical realization of the birds was not straightforward, but it worked out in the end. The scene is very much inspired by a scene from the movie "The Amazing Life of Walter Mitty".</p></div><div class=gallery-image><video autoplay muted loop>
