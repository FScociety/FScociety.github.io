As a fan of the Netflix series "Lost in Space" I tried to model the spaceship "Jupiter". I also wanted to make a small animation and this short film was the result.

## Story

The story is relatively short. You see a spaceship (Jupiter) flying into a portal and reappearing near a black hole. There it has lost control and is pulled into it. The whole thing is ends in a bluescreen.

## Jupiter Model

I kept the spaceship very close to the Lost in Space template. It was difficult to get the exact dimensions right, since there were no blueprints or similar online. My only templates were excerpts from the series.

## Animation

The black hole was created in a separate project. It's a mix of geometry and a combination of different shaders to achieve the atmospheric look
