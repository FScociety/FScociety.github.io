## Intro

I am currently studying VFX in the second semester at Animationsinstitut Baden WÃ¼rttemberg here in Germany. About a month ago I finished a for me big VFX short for a short film produced by the uni. The shoot I did in the end, was a big blood simulation filling up a drawing room. I learned a lot during the process and wanted to share it in this post.

## On set

I had the luck to be VFX sup on set to make sure everything would work out in post. It was my first time doing this kind of job in a real production enviroment. For help I had a vfx colleage from the second year who give me small introduction to the equipment: 360 degree camera, lens grid, color checker and a chroma ball.
He also prepared a nice list of the important shots and what things to capture on set. This was really helpful.
I was there one day before shooting and could capture a 3d scan of the empty room, which really saved my ass in post, more to that later. 

For all the 3d scanning I was just taking a video with my phone and uploading it to the lumaAI app. This gave decent results really quick ( processing is taking around 30min ). Another advantage is, it processes in the cloud for free, so i dont need a powerfull pc on set to see the result. I also like the convidence of knowing if the scan worked out or not, as soon as possible.

For the big blood simulation I did a lot of scans. There were 6 persons in the room and for each I did a 3 minute video. I also did a 15 minute going through the room without the character which sadly failed ( here the scan from the beginning was handy ). I also did capture different positions with the color checker and the chrome ball ( in the end I should have done one fluent capture from front to back, cause the )
