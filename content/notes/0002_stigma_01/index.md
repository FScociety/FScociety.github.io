## Intro

I am currently studying VFX in the second semester at Animationsinstitut Baden WÃ¼rrtemberg here in Germany.
Till about two months' ago I was working for a student project produced by the uni.
*A link will be added, when the movie is released.*
For this project I did a big fluid simulation in post and was doing on set supervision.
This post is going to cover my experience on set.



## 3d scanning ( why I love lumaAI )

From the beginning I knew it would be best to collect as many scans as possible.
I collected 3d scans of every actor, the room, 2 assets.
I used LumaAI for every scan. For this project it had some nice advantages:
- Free ( compared to polycam )

- really robust with no manual work needed. For some subject it works like magic compared realitycapture where i often had to help to manual add aligning points

- everything can be done with your phone and the processing takes happen on their servers

- Fast and easy to preview. It would often take only 20 minutes for the scan to be ready. I would also know if it worked and would be still on set to think about solutions.

Seriously I **love** LumaAI and have no idea how they can be profitable, I think they aren't and are just burning through VC money

**One Tip:** I would not recommend to use the app for capturing. From my experience you can just take a video with your phone and upload the file to the app. It still works really great but you can still upload the capture to other platforms if needed.



## old shit!

I had the luck to be VFX sup on set to make sure everything would work out in post. It was my first time doing this kind of job in a real production enviroment. For help I had a vfx colleage from the second year who give me small introduction to the equipment: 360 degree camera, lens grid, color checker and a chroma ball.
He also prepared a nice list of the important shots and what things to capture on set. This was really helpful.
I was there one day before shooting and could capture a 3d scan of the empty room, which really saved my ass in post, more to that later. 

For all the 3d scanning I was just taking a video with my phone and uploading it to the lumaAI app. This gave decent results really quick ( processing is taking around 30min ). Another advantage is, it processes in the cloud for free, so i dont need a powerfull pc on set to see the result. I also like the convidence of knowing if the scan worked out or not, as soon as possible.

For the big blood simulation I did a lot of scans. There were 6 persons in the room and for each I did a 3 minute video. I also did a 15 minute going through the room without the character which sadly failed ( here the scan from the beginning was handy ). I also did capture different positions with the color checker and the chrome ball ( in the end I should have done one fluent capture from front to back, cause the )
