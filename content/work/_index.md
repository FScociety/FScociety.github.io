## Photography
I'm usually creating digital stuff in 3D, but I also like to switch it up with some photography. It's more about capturing moments as they are and not spending hours tryin to creating some.

## Programming
I'm into artistic stuff but also like the tech side. I do some coding to make things easier in Blender, and sometimes I dabble in game making.
