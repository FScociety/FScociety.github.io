The lama short film (title yet to be determined) is my current project that I have been working on since the winter of 2021. The lama is a 3D scan of a real llama stuffed animal. For this, I took around 350 photos of the stuffed animal in good lighting conditions. For this it was important to capture all possible perspectives.

## Story

The story is about a lama that is asleep at first. Meanwhile a washing machine in the basement wakes up and spits out a strange carrot. The lama is attracted by this carrot and it finds more washing machines that spit out these carrots. The further course is not completely clear and in general probably a few things will change, but I always find it nice to leave the story a little open and not even know the end myself.

## Lama Model

The lama is a 3D scan of a real lama stuffed animal. This took several hundred pictures from every possible perspective. In RealityCapture I then merged the whole thing into a 3D model and then reworked it in Blender.

This time I put a lot of emphasis on the visual drama. The style was inspired by the analog film "Cinestill 800 T". It has very vivid colors and has around bright lights the typical orange glow, also called halation. By using this style I am trying to create a certain degree of realism and believability. With the editing i try to get rid of the problem that 3D animated images often look very clinical.

In a few scenes I placed the lama in environments captured with a real camera. It was very important to me that the two worlds (real image and CGI) are combined convincingly. For this I rendered different layers that help to connect the two worlds: Shadow, Indirect, Diffuse, Reflective and Emitting Light. On top of everything I also added impurities like halation, noise and overexposure.
