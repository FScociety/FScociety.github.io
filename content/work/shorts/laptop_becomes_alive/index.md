A funny thought ...

## Story

It's about a little laptop that comes to life and also can walk. He breaks out of the house and runs out into the world. In the evening, he comes across a shop window that shows people destroying machines. This makes him very angry.

## Animation

    For the animation I used several so-called constraints. With them you can set certain conditions on objects in Blender. For example, that the foot always points in the direction of the holder, which is similar to the behavior of a gear.
